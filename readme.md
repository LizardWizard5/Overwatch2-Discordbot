# Discord bot using Overwatch 2 api

## A Discord bot I am making using api from [Overfast API](https://github.com/TeKrop/overfast-api).

### I have not explored everything in this API but I am hoping to be able to pull character stats and player stats

<h1>TO-DO</h1>
<li>Figure out a way to make the image output bigger for the player data command.</li>
<li>Make images for the other commands</li>
<li>Add shop tracking using web-scraping (API does not have the shop)</li>
